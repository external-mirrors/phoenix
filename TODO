Remove HashMaps usage when the key is an integer. Iterating an array is faster.
Return Length error if request length header isn't long enough for the message.
Support BIG-REQUESTS extension.
Use auth if there is one added in xauthority file for the path (X1 is $USER/unix:1)
    and validate client connection against it. Right now we accept all connections.
Use epoll equivalent on other OS'.
Move protocol definition and request/reply handling to a separate repository as it can also be used for a zig native x11 client.
