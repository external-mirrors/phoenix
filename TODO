Remove HashMaps usage when the key is an integer. Iterating an array is faster.
Return Length error if request length header isn't long enough for the message.
Support BIG-REQUESTS extension.
Use auth if there is one added in xauthority file for the path (X1 is $USER/unix:1)
    and validate client connection against it. Right now we accept all connections.
Use epoll equivalent on other OS'.
Move protocol definition and request/reply handling to a separate repository as it can also be used for a zig native x11 client.
Implement xc-misc extension, might be needed in practice for gtk/qt applications that spam new resources every frame.
Use composition by default, but if any application gets the overlay window with GetCompositeOverlayWindow then turn it off until the composite overlay window is released.
Maybe break x11 protocol standard and use the top 3 bits in resource id?
Handle error.InvalidEnumTag in request.read_request using std.meta.intToEnum. It should return an x11 .value error.
Move backend to a separate process which has can be restarted. Restarting works without losing graphics contexts since pixmaps save the dmabuf fd, which it can re-import if the backend process is restarted.
Use timerfd (linux only) for epoll friendly timer timeout.
Use eventfd (linux only) for epoll friendly manual event trigger, that unblocks the epoll wait.
    This is useful for example for writing events to client when rendering is done (in a separate thread).
