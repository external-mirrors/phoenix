Remove HashMaps usage when the key is an integer. Iterating an array is faster.
Return Length error if request length header isn't long enough for the message.
Support BIG-REQUESTS extension.
Use auth if there is one added in xauthority file for the path (X1 is $USER/unix:1)
    and validate client connection against it. Right now we accept all connections.
Use epoll equivalent on other OS'.
Move protocol definition and request/reply handling to a separate repository as it can also be used for a zig native x11 client.
Implement xc-misc extension, might be needed in practice for gtk/qt applications that spam new resources every frame.
Use composition by default, but if any application gets the overlay window with GetCompositeOverlayWindow then turn it off until the composite overlay window is released.
Maybe break x11 protocol standard and use the top 3 bits in resource id?
Handle error.InvalidEnumTag in request.read_request using std.meta.intToEnum. It should return an x11 .value error.
Move backend to a separate process which has can be restarted. Restarting works without losing graphics contexts since pixmaps save the dmabuf fd, which it can re-import if the backend process is restarted.
Use timerfd (linux only) for epoll friendly timer timeout.
Use eventfd (linux only) for epoll friendly manual event trigger, that unblocks the epoll wait.
    This is useful for example for writing events to client when rendering is done (in a separate thread).
Close the program if the nested x11 window is closed.
Instead of creating and destroying opengl textures for each window/pixmap each time, create textures and re-use them; never destroying them.
    This is more efficient and leads to lower memory usage (nvidia leaks memory on texture create/destroy, on purpose).
Draw windows in tree order (the grandchildren of root, then children then root).
Client might set any of the top resource id bits to 1. What do?
Eglgears_x11 crashes after a few seconds because there is an x11 error in the reply to getInputFocus (not the first one) and it happens near the end of the second sequence_number wrap.
Replace all std.meta.intToEnum with a more efficient variant that does a direct cast if the value is in range, without iterating all enum values (if the enum has ordered values).
glxGetVisualConfigs and glxGetFbConfigs doesn't seem to return the correct amount of data? glxinfo shows less data than we return.
If writing data to client buffer fails partially (is that possible?) then discard the bytes written so we dont send partial data to client.
Go through all requests and make sure they are all implemented correctly as according to the spec and make end-to-end tests for all of them and unit tests as well.
Vulkan applications (vkcube) spam dri3 requests in render, but not with the xorg server. Why?
Get current tty with /proc/self/stat, see `man proc_pid_stat`.
When implementing reparent consider that the client might attempt to reparent a window to one of its children (or grandchildren) or itself. Handle that case according to spec.
When SelectInput is added in more extensions then handle case when attempting to use an event id that belongs to another extension.
